This repository contains the backend server for the Dynamic Energy Control System

The server runs on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 and provides a secure API

for mobile applications to control smart outlets and retrieve system status.


Current features:

- Health endpoint
- Simple authentication prototype
- Outlet control endpoints

Future work:

- Bluetooth communication with outlet controllers
- Token based authentication
- TLS and certificate based security
